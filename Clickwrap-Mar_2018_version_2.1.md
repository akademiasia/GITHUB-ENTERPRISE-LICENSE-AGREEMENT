applicable License Term or Professional Services, as such fees are reflected on an Order Form
or SOW.


“GitHub **Partner** ” means a company authorized to resell GitHub Products under the terms and
conditions of GitHub’s Channel Partner Agreement.

"**License**" means a data file used by the Software's access control mechanism that allows
Customer to install, operate, and use the Software during the License Term.

"**License Key**" is the means by which a License is delivered via a secure, password-protected
website.

"**License Term**" means the period of one (1) year from the License Effective Date unless an
alternate period is specified in an Order Form. GitHub will provide Customer with a renewal
notice at least sixty (60) days before the expiration of License Term and will generate a new

Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to
install and use a single production License of the Software (unless otherwise stated in an Order
Form) for its internal business purposes during the applicable License Term, in accordance with
the Scope of Use and Documentation, and only for the number and type of Seats stated in an
Order Form. Customer may make copies of the Software for non-production purposes only,
such as testing, staging or quality assurance purposes, provided that Customer reproduces all
copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on the original copy of the Software.
Customer’s Affiliates, agents and contractors (together, “ **Authorized Third Parties** ”) may use
the Software also, so long as its Authorized Third Parties are using it on Customer’s behalf and
Customer agrees to remain fully responsible for its Authorized Third Parties’ behavior under this
Agreement.

**3. License Restrictions.** As between the Parties, GitHub owns all right, title and interest in and
to the Software, and any intellectual property rights associated with it and with GitHub, Inc.
GitHub reserves all rights in and to the Software not expressly granted to Customer in this
Agreement. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, by law, or by applicable third
party license, Customer and its Affiliates must not and must not allow any third party to: (i)
sublicense, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, or redistribute the Software; (ii) host the Software
for the benefit of third parties; (iii) disclose or permit any third party to access the Software,
except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (iv) hack or modify the License Key, or avoid
or change any license registration process; (v) modify or create derivative works of the
Software, or merge the Software with other software; (vi) disassemble, decompile, bypass any
code obfuscation, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to derive any of its
source code, in whole or in part; (vii) modify, obscure, or delete any proprietary rights notices
included in or on the Software or Documentation; (viii) otherwise use or copy the Software in a
manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement; or (ix) use the Software beyond its

**4. Modifications to the Software.** Customer may modify the Software solely for purpose of
developing bug fixes, customizations and additional features to any libraries licensed under
open source licenses that may be included with or linked to by the Software (“ **Customer
Modifications** ”). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, GitHub has no
support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or liability with respect to Customer
Modifications or its combination, interaction or use with the Software. Customer must indemnify,
defend and hold GitHub harmless from and against all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection
with any claim brought against GitHub by a third party relating to Customer Modifications
(including but not limited to any representations or warranties Customer makes about Customer
Modifications to the Software).

**5. Third Party Code.** GitHub’s Software includes code and libraries licensed to GitHub by third
parties, including software whose licenses require GitHub to make the source code for those
components available. The source code for such components will be provided upon request.
Before a new component is added to GitHub’s Software, GitHub completes a process for
ensuring such component is under terms that GitHub can safely distribute and Customer can
use. GitHub warrants that the Software does not and will not include any software distributed
under a license that would: (a) affect Customer’s proprietary rights in its product(s) or data, (b)
subject Customer to any obligation to disclose, distribute or license its own product(s) in source
code form or otherwise make the product(s) available for use by others or for the purpose of
creating derivative works, or (c) add or place any more onerous restrictions on Customer’s use
of the Software than is included in this Agreement.

**6. Seats.** Only one person may be associated with a User account. Customer may swap out,
delete, or suspend a User, and then assign a new User to the open Seat. If Customer needs
more Seats, it must submit a new request through GitHub’s website or via our sales team, and
pay for the additional Seats (a new Order Form will be generated). If Customer purchases
additional Seats, it must pay the then-currently applicable Fees for those Seats, prorated for the
balance of the applicable License Term. When the time comes to renew Customers’ Seats for
another License Term, GitHub will invoice all Seats at once on an annual basis unless otherwise
specified in an Order Form. Customer agrees that any Orders for additional Seats during the
term of this Agreement will be governed by this Agreement.

**7. Payment.**

**7.1** Customer agrees to pay the Fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in
U.S. Dollars (or Professional Services Credits, if applicable) unless otherwise specified in an


Order Form or unless purchasing through an authorized third party. If Customer is purchasing
through an authorized third party, then payment terms will be agreed upon between Customer
and the authorized third party. Customer must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the date of
the invoice that GitHub sends Customer related to the applicable SOW or Order Form. Amounts
payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as provided in Sections 12.1 and
13.3. If Customer fails to pay the Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking
any other action at law or equity, to charge Customer interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per
month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to additionally charge
all expenses of recovery. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and
governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed
or become due in connection with this Agreement. GitHub may also, at its sole option, elect to
terminate the Order Form and Agreement.

**7.2** If Customer uses its pre-paid Professional Services Credits as the means of payment for
Professional Services, then upon Customer's receipt of an SOW, the applicable Professional
Services Credits will be deducted from Customer's Professional Services Credits balance.
Customer is responsible for ensuring that its purchase order ("**PO**") issued to GitHub for the
Professional Services reflects the pricing set forth in the SOW. If there is any difference in
pricing listed in the SOW and the pricing listed in the PO, the pricing in the SOW will control.
The Parties agree that SOWs payable via Professional Services Credits do not have to be
signed by either Party to be valid and enforceable. Subject to the SOW, all Fees paid by
Customer are non-refundable and all Service Credits must be used within the time set forth in
the Order Form or will automatically be cancelled and are non-refundable. Customer cannot
apply Professional Services Credits to travel and lodging expenses, which must be invoiced
separately.

**8. Delivery.** Promptly after the applicable License Effective Date, GitHub will make the Software
and the License available for Customer to download on a secure, password-protected website.
All deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer is
responsible for installation of any Software and acknowledges that GitHub has no further
delivery obligation with respect to the Software after delivery of the License. As Updates
become available, GitHub will make those available for download on the same website.
Customer must Update the Software on a commercially reasonable basis but no less than one
(1) time per year. Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its usernames
and passwords, including those it uses to download the Software and is responsible for any
activity with respect to its usernames and passwords.

**9. Verification.** At GitHub’s request, Customer agrees to promptly provide GitHub with a
Software-generated report that verifies that Customer is using the Software in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, including the Scope of Use. If GitHub determines that Customer
has exceeded its Scope of Use, then in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity,
GitHub will invoice Customer for any additional use, effective from the date Customer exceeded
the Scope of Use.

**10. Support.** Subject to Customer’s compliance with this Agreement, GitHub will provide
technical support for the Software as further described in the attached Exhibit A (Support
Terms) during the period that Customer has paid the Fees (if applicable). Support includes
access to Updates, as they are made available.

**11. Professional Services.** Upon Customer’s request, GitHub will provide a Statement of Work
(“SOW”) detailing the Professional Services in a form substantially similar to Exhibit C attached
hereto. Each SOW is binding upon signature by the Parties and any Professional Services will
be governed by the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of
this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement will control. GitHub must perform the
Professional Services described in each SOW according to the timeframes set forth in that
SOW. GitHub will control the manner and means by which the Professional Services are
performed and reserve the right to determine which personnel is/are assigned to perform the
Professional Services. GitHub may use third parties to perform the Professional Services
provided GitHub remains responsible for all their acts and omissions. Customer acknowledges
that GitHub retains all right, title and interest in and to anything used or developed in connection
with performing the Professional Services, including, among other things, software programs,
tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions, processes, techniques, and know-how. To the
extent GitHub delivers anything to Customer during the course of performing the Professional
Services, GitHub grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free,
limited-term license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement, solely in
conjunction with Customer’s use of the Software.

**12. Limited Warranties.**

**12.1** _Limited Software Warranties_. GitHub represents and warrants that: (i) the unmodified
Software, at the time it is made available to Customer for download, will not contain or transmit
any malware, viruses, or worms (otherwise known as computer code or other technology
specifically designed to disrupt, disable, or harm Customer’s software, hardware, computer
system, or network) and (ii) for ninety (90) days from the date it is made available for initial
download, the unmodified Software will substantially conform to its Documentation. GitHub does
not warrant that Customer’s use of the Software will be uninterrupted, or that the operation of
the Software will be error-free. These warranties will not apply if Customer modifies or uses the
Software in any way that is not expressly permitted by this Agreement and the Documentation.
GitHub’s only obligation, and Customer’s only remedy, for any breach of these limited
warranties will be, at GitHub’s option and expense, to either (i) repair the Software; (ii) replace
the Software; or (iii) terminate this Agreement with respect to the defective Software, and refund
the unused, prepaid Fees for the defective Software during the then-current License Term.

**12.2** _Professional Services Warranty._ Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, GitHub represents
and warrants that any Professional Services performed under this Agreement will be performed
in a professional and workmanlike manner by appropriately qualified personnel. GitHub’s only
obligation, and Customer’s only remedy, for a breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub’s option
and expense, to either: (i) promptly re-perform any Professional Services that fail to meet this
limited warranty or (ii) if the breach of limited warranty cannot be cured, terminate the SOW and
GitHub will refund Customer the unused prepaid Fees.

**12.3** _General Warranty._ Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and
authority to enter into this Agreement, and that this Agreement and each Order Form is entered
into by an employee or agent of such Party with all necessary authority to bind such Party to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

**12.4** _Warranty Disclaimer_. THE LIMITED WARRANTIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE THE ONLY
WARRANTIES GITHUB MAKES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND
SUPPORT. GITHUB DOES NOT MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES AND
REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, AND HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY
OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS ARISING OUT
OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION,
WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, PROVIDED BY GITHUB OR ANYWHERE ELSE WILL
CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS
AGREEMENT.

**13. Indemnification.**

**13.1** _GitHub’s Indemnification Obligation_. GitHub will defend and indemnify Customer against
any third-party claim brought against Customer to the extent that it is based on an allegation
that Customer’s authorized use or possession of the Software infringes a U.S. copyright or
misappropriates a trade secret of any third party (each, a "Claim"), and pay damages and costs
(including reasonable legal fees) awarded by a court of final appeal attributable to such a Claim,
provided that Customer: (i) notify GitHub in writing of any such Claim as soon as reasonably
practicable; (ii) allow GitHub to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if
applicable) of the Claim, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with GitHub in the defense of any such
Claim and related settlement negotiations.

**13.2** _Exclusions_. GitHub’s indemnity obligation must not extend to any Claim that is based on: (i)
the modification or use of the Software other than as authorized by this Agreement (including
the Documentation); (ii) Customer’s failure to stop using the Software after receiving written
notice to do so in order to avoid further infringement or misappropriation; or (iii) the combination,
operation or use of the Software with equipment, devices, software, systems, or data not
authorized by this Agreement (including the Documentation) to the extent that without such
combination the Software would have avoided a Claim (subparts (i)-(iii) may be referred to
collectively as "Indemnity Exclusions").

**13.3** _Right to Ameliorate Damages_. If Customer’s use of the Software is, or in GitHub’s
reasonable opinion is likely to be, subject to a Claim under Section 13.1, GitHub may, in its sole
option and at no charge to Customer (and in addition to GitHub’s indemnity obligation in Section
13.1): (i) procure the right to continue using the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software so
that it is non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the original Software; or (iii) if
options (i) and (ii) above are not commercially practicable in GitHub’s reasonable estimation,
terminate this Agreement and all licenses granted hereunder (in which event, Customer must
immediately stop using the Software) and GitHub must refund the unused, pre-paid Fees for the
then-current License Term.

**13.4** _Sole Remedy_. THIS SECTION 13 SETS FORTH GITHUB’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
OBLIGATIONS, AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT
TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF THIRD PARTY
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

**13.5** _Customer’s Indemnification Obligation_. Customer will defend and indemnify GitHub from
and against any claims that may arise out of or that are based upon (i) Customer’s breach of
confidentiality; (ii) content that Customer uploads to the Software; or (iii) an Indemnity Exclusion.

**14.1** _Waiver of Consequential Damages_. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GITHUB BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR TO ANY
THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA)
OR FOR THE COST OF OBTAINING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY
ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT GITHUB
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**14.2** _Limitation of Total Liability_. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, GITHUB’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF
LIABILITY, WILL BE LIMITED TO AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID
DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH
LIABILITY.

**15. Confidentiality.**

**15.1** _Definition of Confidential Information_. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" means any business or technical information that either Party discloses to the
other, in writing, orally, or by any other means, including disclosures like computer programs,
code, algorithms, data, know-how, formulas, processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable
or not), schematics and other technical, business, financial, and product development plans,
names and expertise of employees and consultants, and customer lists. For the purposes of this
Agreement, except as expressly set forth in Section 5, the source code of the Software will be
deemed to be GitHub's Confidential Information, regardless of whether it is marked as such.

**15.2** _Restrictions on Use and Disclosure._ Neither Party will use the other Party's Confidential
Information, except as permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in
confidence and protect the other Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree
of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in all events at least a
reasonable degree of care. Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any
unauthorized disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, including, without
limitation, disclosing Confidential Information only to its employees, independent contractors,
consultants, and legal and financial advisors (collectively, "Representatives") (i) with a need to
know such information, (ii) who are parties to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with
this Section 15, and (iii) who are informed of the non-disclosure obligations imposed by this
Section 15. Each Party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The
foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the
other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
governmental body, provided that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives
reasonable notice to the other Party to enable them to contest such order or requirement. The
restrictions set forth in this Section 15 will survive the termination or expiration of this
Agreement.

**15.3** _Exclusions_. The restrictions set forth in Section 15.2 will not apply with respect to any

(iv) the receiving party independently develops without access to or use of the other Party's
Confidential Information.

**16. Term and Termination.**

**16.1** _Agreement Term_. This Agreement starts on the Agreement Effective Date and will continue
in effect until this Agreement is terminated by a Party in accordance with this Section 16. If this
Agreement is terminated before the expiration or termination of a License Term, then any active
Order Forms will remain in force pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

**16.2** _Termination for Convenience_. Either Party may terminate an Order Form, with or without
cause, upon at least thirty (30) days written notice before the end of the then-current License
Term stated in the Order Form.

**16.3** _Termination for Material Breach_. Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately
upon notice if the other Party breaches a material obligation under this Agreement and fails to
cure the breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives notification. Either Party
reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice, but without
giving the other Party a cure period, if Customer breaches any of the terms of this Agreement
relating to GitHub’s intellectual property (including Customer’s compliance with the license grant
and any license restrictions) or either Party’s Confidential Information.

**16.4** _Effect of Termination; Survival._ When this Agreement terminates or expires, Customer may
not execute additional Order Forms; however, the Agreement will remain in full force and effect
for the remainder of any active Order Forms. When an Order Form terminates or expires, as to
that Order Form: (i) the License Term for any Software will immediately end; (ii) Customer will
no longer have the right to use the Software, and any Licenses granted in the Order Form will
automatically cease to exist as of the date of termination or expiration; (iii) if any Fees were
owed prior to termination, Customer must pay those Fees immediately; (iv) Customer must
destroy all copies of the Software in its possession or control, and certify in writing to GitHub
that it has done so; and (v) each Party will promptly return to the other (or, if the other party
requests it, destroy) all Confidential Information belonging to the other. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Customer may continue to access the Software to migrate its data for ninety (90)
days after termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form; however, Customer
must not use the Software on a production basis during that time. Any terms or sections which
by their nature should reasonably survive will survive the termination or expiration of this
Agreement or an Order Form.

**17.8** _Independent Contractors_. The Parties are each independent contractors with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed or
construed in any manner to create a legal association, partnership, joint venture, employment,
agency, fiduciary, or other similar relationship between the Parties, and neither Party can bind
the other contractually.

**17.9** _Waiver_. A Party's obligations under this Agreement must only be waived in a writing signed
by an authorized representative of the other Party, which waiver will be effective only with
respect to the specific obligation described. No failure or delay by a Party to this Agreement in
exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right
hereunder at law or equity.

**17.10** _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including each Order Form and SOW, constitutes the
entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to its subject matter, and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether oral or
written, between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. The terms of any purchase order,
written terms or conditions, or other document that Customer submits to GitHub that contains
